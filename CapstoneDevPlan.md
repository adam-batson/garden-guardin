# **Capstone Development Plan**

## **Developer:** Adam Batson [GitHub](https://github.com/tabatson) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/t-a-batson)

## **Project Title:** Untitled HTML5 Game Project (WIP)

<br>

# **Summary**

### **Problem Solved**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project fulfills a life-long goal of mine. I knew I was strongly drawn to make a video game, but was unsure if it would make a good capstone project. I discussed with my mentor and we agreed that a finished game with clean code will demonstrate how far I've come these last six months.

### **How is the Problem Solved?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will fulfill my goals in several ways:

- **Practice improving an existing design**
  - Completing this game in steps will be valuable experience making smaller goals and iterating on a project.
- **Starting point for future development**
  - Completing one game will develop skills and confidence that I can use to create more games in the future.
- **Public release**
  - Putting this game online allows people worldwide to enjoy it and provides feedback that I can use to improve it and future games.
- **Satisfaction of a life goal**
  - I've always wanted to make a video game and having dedicated work time and a deadline helps motivate me to complete it.

### **Skills & Technologies**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the coding skills I've built over the last six months as a Leap Apprentice to learn the Phaser 3 framework in a short time and create a game. I created my own art assets with Aseprite as well.

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project primarily uses Phaser 3, a JavaScript framework for making games. Tools used are:

- ### [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
  - This is the framework that I'll use the most. It's designed to work on most modern browsers, and it's especially designed to work on mobile.
- ### [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  - The Live Server plugin for VS Code does not work so this is required. Parcel provides a dev server to test the project on and requires very little work to get it running.
- ### [Itch.io](https://itch.io/)
  - Itch.io is hosting this game. You can follow the provided instructions to run this locally or just head over to Itch and play it!
- ### [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)

  - Aseprite was used to create sprites for this game.
