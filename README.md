# **Capstone Development Plan**

## **Project Title:** Untitled HTML5 Game Project (WIP)

<br>

# **Summary**

### **Problem Solved**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project fulfills a life-long goal that I've had since I was a child. I've made console app games, and they were fun to build, but now I am going to make a video game with visual and audio effects and host it online for others to play.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was unsure what this project should be. I knew I was strongly drawn to make a video game, but was unsure if it would make a good capstone project. After discussing it with my mentor, I decided to go for it. A finished game with clean code will demonstrate how far I've come the last six months from "Hello World!".

### **How is the Problem Solved?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will fulfill my goals in several ways:

- **Practice improving an existing design**
  - Completing this game and working to improve it going forward will be valuable experience making smaller goals and iterating on a project.
- **Starting point for future development**
  - If I can complete one game, I will develop more skills and confidence that I can use to create more games in the future.
- **Public release**
  - I intend to make this game available online for free, which will allow me to gather feedback.
  - This could provide entertainment to people looking to pass a bit of time
- **Satisfaction of a life goal**
  - I've always wanted to make a game like this and having dedicated work time and a deadline will help motivate me. Completing this will help sustain that motivation into further projects.

### **Skills & Technologies**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will need be using the coding skills I've built over the last six months (especially relating to JavaScript) as a Leap Apprentice in combination with my artistic ability to create a game and its assets.

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will primarily use JavaScript, Node.js, and some frameworks and libraries to aid in game development. Some of these include:

- ### [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
  - This is the framework that I'll use the most. It's designed to work on most modern browsers, and it's especially designed to work on mobile.
- ### [Itch.io](https://itch.io/)
  - I will use Itch to host the game because people can play it for free and it's accessible from anywhere. It's also free to upload and host.
- ### [Sketchbook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adsk.sketchbook&hl=en_US&gl=US)
  - I use a Samsung Galaxy Note10+, which includes an SPen. Combined with an SPen, Sketchbook is an incredible app for drawing which allows layers. This allows me to create sprite sheets for use with Phaser. I may use Aseprite with/instead of this.
- ### [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)

  - Phaser has built-in functionality for Aseprite sprite sheets. This allows layers for pixel art spriting and is fairly easy to use. I may use Sketchbook with/instead of this.
