## **Description**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project fulfills a life-long goal of mine to create a video game. I discussed ideas with my mentor and we agreed that a finished game with clean code will demonstrate how far I've come these last six months.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Garden Guardin'_ primarily uses Phaser 3, a JavaScript library that uses node.js for making HTML5 games. I used Parcel for its dev server functionality, Aseprite for spriting, and hosted the game on Itch.io.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the game has one level, four enemies, and a boss. In the future, I want to create more levels with a wider variety of enemies and new bosses. I also want to implement environmental effects or obstacles.

### **How to Play**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In _Garden Guardin'_, you are a gardener trying to drive off pests in the garden. This game is very heavily inspired by Gnat Attack from Mario Paint.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the pests to whack them with your spade. Pests come in waves, and some do not do any harm to you, while others do. You can only take 3 hits so avoid projectiles!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you whack 100 pests, the boss will appear! You can defeat it in 20 hits, but it uses several attacks against you.

# **Installation**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to play this game and you don't need the code, **I recommend doing that [here]().** <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install and run this game, you'll need node.js and npm installed. After that, clone the repo, then run:
```
 npm install phaser
